MODIFICATIONS APPLIED
- Added src/components/EmojiIcon.jsx : maps common emojis to lucide-react icons, falls back to text when lucide-react isn't installed.
- Added src/styles/theme.css : responsive + light/dark CSS variables and utility classes.
- Added src/utils/theme.js : simple theme init & toggle helpers (call initTheme() on app start).
- Replaced emoji characters in 2 source files with <EmojiIcon char="..."/>. Backups with .bak extension were created for modified files.
- Created this ZIP: /mnt/data/hackathon_modified.zip

IMPORTANT:
- This script does NOT install npm packages. To use lucide-react icons, run in your project folder:
    npm install lucide-react

- To apply Tailwind properly, follow Tailwind installation for your framework (Vite/CRA). I left a simple theme.css to work immediately without Tailwind; if you want full Tailwind integration I can add the config and boilerplate (but that requires npm install).
